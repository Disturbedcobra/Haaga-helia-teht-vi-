## A) Install TOR

I started the task by downloading tor browser from `https://www.torproject.org/download/` and then i when to the downloads directory in command line. I used `ls`command to see what name the file had and unzipped it using `tar xf tor-browser-linux-x86_64-14.0.7.tar.xz`. i then went inside the new directory unzipped from the downloaded file.

I started the tor browser with the runnable command found in the directory using `./start-tor-browser.desktop`. after tor browser had launched i pressed connect in the middle of the browser and then searched for ahmia that is well known darknet search service.

After getting into to ahmia website i clicked onion service at the bottom of the site to allow myself to start searching from darknet.
