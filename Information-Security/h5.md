# H5 Uryyb, Greb!

## Read and summarize

### Schneier 

- The 2 terms used for different texts  are plaintext for non encrypted files and ciphertext for encrypted ones. encryption is hiding the text and decryption is making it visible.

-  some cultures see encrypt and decrypt as insulting though standard terms are encipher and decipher.

-  this science is called cryptography and analyzing it is called cryptanalysis while mathematics on the field is called cryptology.

### Karvinen 2023

- step by step guide on using gpg on linux command line

- Public keys work in pairs and both are needed for decrypting and encrpyting

- fingerprints are used to determing if the keys are the right persons.


## Install SSH

i started by updating package manager with sudo apt-get update and then installed openssh using sudo apt-get install ssh command. Next i logged into my server using ssh 127.0.0.1 command with address meaning same as localhost. after this i was asked confirmation for the connection.

## Automated ssh

I used ssh-keygen command to make myself a public key. then i added it to my server using ssh-copy-id user@server.

i tested also using ssh localhost and ssh 127.0.0.1 which both also worked but only because the server is running on localhost instead of in another address.


## encrypt

First i installed gpg and micro using apt-get install. then i created a public key using gpg --gen-key and tested if it work with gpg --fingerprint.

next i created a public key using gpg --gen-key, and a new text file using micro called moi.txt. after that i encrypted the file with gpg command shown below used ls to see that it made the new encrypted file and decrypted it using the last command in the picture below.

## password manager

i decided to pick keepassxc to learn and demonstrate. it was easy to get started and can be installed using package manager by using sudo apt-get install keepassxc.

you can have multiple databases and creating them is super easy just press the create database button

then you name it

next you can adjust the time for encrypting making passwords more protected there are advanced settings aswell if you know what you are doing.

this is waht advanced settings look like.

next you can give password to your database. i like how it has a feature that tells you how weak the password you aare making is with a colored line.
