## Threat modeling

### Braiterman

- used to recognize what can go wrong in the system.
- everyone should use threat modeling who are concerned of privacy, safety and security of their system.
- manifesto uses two guidelines called value and principles.

### Shostack

- think of threat modeling as a whiteboard. multiple people can draw at the same time and figure out what were wroking on.
- record a document for improving system and showing others what you have done for it.
- uncontrolled entities are shown as sharp boxes, codes and running processes are smooth edget, data flow is an arrow, trust boundaries are dotted squeres and data stores are a cylinder.
- threat modeling precedes risk management and informs it.

### OWASP

- threat modeling is used to identify potential security issues during the design phase.
- no universally accepted industry standard for modeling process.
- Brainstorming supports better communication and mutual understanding of system and its issues.
- there are many challenges in threat modeling including unexperienced developers in security matters, time-consumption and complexity.

## Infosec EP 150: MOBMAN 2

- interview of the man claiming of creating the sub7 malware.
- Greg "mobman" was arrested at the same time as the mobman disappeared.
- started using mobman name in 1999. Comes from a romanian rap band B.U.G Mafia.
- claims to own the real source code that isnt in github or anywhere else.


# A) Security hygiene

- use password management for avoiding using easy and similar passwords on multiple platforms.
- avoid using public wifi connections.
- dont use public usb charging stations only use power outlets that needs ur own adapter.
- dont share passwords.
- change paswwords regularly.
- avoid suspicious emails and websites.
- dont share valuable information like bank details.

# B) Make-belief boogie-man 

## 1) what are we working on?

Company system

customer is the king

  - show/advertise products sold on webstore to customers and ship them to specified addresses.
  - customer can only see our webstore as a touchpoint.

## 2) what can go wrong?

  Stride methodology example
  - spoofing: customer can make alternative accounts 
  - Tampering: data and system should not be able to access by unauthorized people since they are only shown webstore with customer accounts. management not done within website
  - Repudiation: customers can say that they didnt order a product
  - information disclosure: incase of database breach information might be leaked
  - denial of service: as the store is run in internet ddos and other attacks are possible
  - elevation of privilege: as webstore only uses customer accounts, access levels shouldnt be a problem except if they find a way into the database itself. 

  biggest risks
    - databreach to database that leads to leak on company and customer information
    - website attack attempts can be expected but should be minimnal as long as database isnt accessed.
    - company computer accessing by outside entities could lead to data leaks and service interruptions.
  
  threat actors
    - as the company is small and sells only products it shouldnt be targeted by political or geographical actors but nothing can be disclosed from possibilities.
    - only intents i can imagine for threat actor would be paid attacks by hostile entities against the company owners.

  business continuity
    - databreach/website being constantly down could lead to loss of reputation and customers not ordering products.
    - customer support in vital importance

## 3) what are we going to do about it?

  - keeping entry points minimal customers are only giving touchpoint of webstore trough customer accounts and no management accounts are made for website. all changes should be made through company computers.

## 4) did we do a good job?

  - as the company is still young and workers are unexperienced start will be rough and not many weakpoints are yet known.
  - not many security points wich will be increased in the future as needed securities are found.
  - pentesting not done heavily in lack of manpower
  - system will be monitored and kept in negotiations continuously in order to keep it as secure as possible
