# February2025!

## X) Summarize

- cryptography solves problems that involve secrecy, authentication, integrity and dishonest people.
- protocol is made of series of steps involving multiple parties and designed to complete a task.
- steps have to be done in order or protocol fails.
- everyone participating in protocol must know all of the steps in advance and agree to follow them.

## A) install Hashcat

I started the task by updating my package manager using this command.

#
    sudo apt-get update

Then i installed Hashcat and hashid. 

#
    sudo apt-get install -y hashcat hashid

Last i tested if the hashid works by analyzing the hash used in the next task using `hashid -m` command that analyzes what type of hash it could be. I also checked if the hashcat was installed properly using `hashcat --version`

## B) Crack Hash

I downloaded rockyou text file from github with command.

#
    wget https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz

Next i unpacked the file using.

#
    tar xf rockyou.txt.tar.gz

and removed the downloaded zipped file.

#
    rm rockyou.txt.tar.gz

This will be used as a dictionary to check if the task hash is the same word as one of the words within specified text file. Since i had allready checked type possibilities for the tasked hash in the previous task. i started cracking the task hash using hash types provided by the analyzes.

#
    hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved

in this code `-m` extra line means what type of hash i am trying to look for. 0 represents the hash type md5. 

then i have the hash that i want to crack.

`rockyou.txt` is the dictionary i am using to see if i get any matches for the hash bing cracked.

lastly  `-o  solved` line means that the solution is saved in a text file.

I got lucky and got it with first try. the hash was md5 type hash and it was one of the words found within the rockyou.txt text file. using `ls` i checked if the answer was saved within the directory and then read it using `cat solved`
