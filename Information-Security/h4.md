## Summarize

### OWASP

#### Broken Access Control

- Access controll is policy enforcement where users cannot act outside of their intended permissions
- Attacks include bypassing access control checks, violation of least privilege, permitted acts using unique identifier, missing access controls for post put delete acts, elevation of privilege, metadata manipulation, cors misconfiguration amd force browsing
- only usable in trusted server-side code or server-less API

#### Security Misconfiguration

- applications usually vulnerable when there are unnecessary features, default accounts, latest security features missing and out of date software
- prevented using repeatable hardening, minimal platform, application segmentation, security directives and verification automation

#### Vulnerable and outdated components

vulnerabilities include: unknown dependacies and component versions, software out of date, not regularly scanning systems, no fix or upgrade on platforms, no compability tests and non secured configurations
prevented with:
- removing unneeded dependencies, features, components, files and docs.
- official components sources only

#### Injection

vulnerable:

- user-supplied data is not validated
- dynamic quaries call without context
- hostile data is used within object- realtional mapping
- hostile data is used in sql or command

Prevented:

- safe api
- positive server-side input validation
- escape special characters
- use sql controls
