# Hello Lab

## Summarize

### Install Debian

- Correct ISO image for Debian installment is live (boots from image and working linux without installing) version (12.x.x Distribution version), amd64 (architecture for most desktops except some MAC users might have arm64) and xfce (writers favourite desktop environment for simplicity and easy configuration).

- important points for virtual box new machine creation are type - linux, version - Debian (64bit), memory size - 4000 MB and hard disk - Create virtual hard disk now: yes.

- Desktops should allways have a good passwords of atleast 9 characters using letters, numbers and special characters.

- command "sudo apt-get update" updates information in the package manager for software installation.

- "sudo apt-get -y install ufw" install a firewall with -y extra line answering yes to confirmation steps automaticly.

- additional steps for easier virtualbox using are guest additions for bigger screen, bidirectional copy paste from settings and snapshotting the machine for backups. 

### Command line basics

- For moving around in directories there are commands like pwd, ls and cd.

- some file manipulation commands are "(text editor) foo.txt" for creating new file, mkdir (name) for new directory and rm for deleting files with -r line for directory deletion.

- for remote access use "ssh (server name)" and when you wanna leave use exit command

- important directories to remember are / (root), /home/, /etc/, /media/ and /var/log/


## A) Can't fish

After login in to my linux i opened the machines settings in virtualbox clicked network, advanced and then ticked off cable connected box and ok.

Next i opened command line in my linux by clicking the terminal icon on the bottom of desktop and used ping command to check if my network was still working.

Linux couldnt connect to the network and task was completed.

## B) Local only

I started the task by installing nmap with "sudo apt-get -y install nmap" command and checked if it worked using version command.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ad72a75-b72b-44db-a471-30ae7c38c75c)

Next i disabled network again from virtualbox settings and tested locally scanning my ports with "sudo nmap localhost" command.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce32b205-ae09-427e-9073-eee8ed819955)

after succesfully scanning ports i could see that i two ports open, 25 used for smtp and 631 for ipp services.

## C) Daemon scan

First i installed apache2 as my new service to portscan. i installed it using "sudo apt-get -y install apache2". After the install was complete i used same portscan command as before "sudo nmap localhost" and saw a new port in the list.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/477d1cb3-db4b-4276-8ed8-ff0e688f7f13)

The new port was 80 which is used for browser services.

## D) over the wire bandit

### level 0

I started this task by installing ssh to my linux using "sudo apt-get -y install ssh".

then i tried logging in to the bandit server using "ssh -l bandit0 -p 2220 bandit.labs.overthewire.org"

extra line -l is for username and -p is for port

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a20f3af-4f8f-45db-94c8-5f9885782941)

after that the server asked for password which was told on the overthewire website to be bandit0.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ebe6be3-9a32-4695-b3c6-7478db7b6a4d)

first level complete

### level 1

next password was hidden inside a text file. first i used "ls" to see files in the directory and saw that there was a readme file. Then i used "cat readme" command to read what the file had inside it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83d772f8-f12a-4bc3-a94d-d2adf151b22e)

I saw the password at the last line and copied it into my text file, after i used "exit" command to close the remote access.

next i had to log into the level 1 server so i used the same command as previously but switched bandit0 to bandit1.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d272abba-b12c-440a-8fc2-1e47f577bd0d)

then i copy pasted the new password i found. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/360503fb-d55c-4fa2-b842-fe5a479a4d48)

Level 1 complete.


### level 2

Next file was located in a dashed file that couldnt be opened with "cat -". after using google i found out that you had to use the full location path by typing "cat ./-".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbe4a37f-435d-477b-8f17-274672dc34fa)

after copying the password i exited the server and logged in to the bandit2 server using same method. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cccc157-ab02-47f7-9461-76e815b4a2e1)

Level 2 complete.

### level 3

Now the file had spaces in the name. after searching for answer i found that using backslash in the cat command helps against this trick and used "cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename".

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92d2deec-071d-4846-83d4-96d6ec6a967a)

I copied the password and used same procedures again to get inside bandit3 server. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6204b4fa-25fe-4e7f-98e5-0bc37fc6b64b)

Level 3 complete.

### level 4

This task had a hidden file that needed to be opened and couldn't be seen with normal ls command. using -a extra line you can see all the files inside even hidden ones so i used "ls -a" and found it.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b2d4312-8c4f-41ad-939f-da24ff182683)

and after the same procedures to get inside bandit4. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb030650-87e4-4363-8b18-74bcc8424b19)

level 4 complete.
